Welcome to the OnTheGears Development Blog! This dev blog will be used to communicate with users about updates and technical challenges. 


<!-- end -->

I have been building [OnTheGears](https://onthegears.com) for a couple months now and I am ready to put this proof of concept into action. The initial idea is a platform where mouse enthusiasts can share and collect (keep track of) their gear. However, that idea has expanded to mouse modifications and possibly other gear in the future. I will talk about the roadmap for this project in a bit, but first I want to talk about the current features OnTheGears has to offer.

# Features

### The Dashboard

Upon visiting the frontpage you are probably thinking that this is just a simple message board. While simple in its current state, it has been tailored to display information about mice and help users understand the ecosystem around the hardware. You can inspect the projects to see what specific model of mice are in the image and any type of modifications made.

### Posting Projects

A user can post a project containing multiple images of mice and then find said mice in our catalogue. From there you can add predefined tags that describe mods applicable to your mice. These tags are meant to be more general and extra details about the change will be in the description.

### Gear Index

The gear page contains a table of all mice in the catalogue. You can search the table for your mouse and use the button in the model column to be directed a page containing a more nicely formatted spec sheet. Along with the better format is the ability to add the mouse to your collection. This will save the mouse to your profile and to display it for all users.

### Profile

The profile page is where you can find a record of all your collected gear and projects. This is the simplest page at the moment, but I have many improvements I want to make including a teased follow functionality.
 
And that is basically the gist of OnTheGears. As I hope you can see all these features are interconnected in some way. Now to discuss the future plans of OnTheGears!

# Roadmap

 These are my planned improvements for OnTheGears. They are broken into the four different features talked about above, along with a general site wide list.
 
* Dashboard
    * Search Functionality
    * Views counter to each project
    * Ability for users to like or upvote a post
    * Filter Functionality Ex. Filter for Gear, Mods, Recently Updated Projects
* Projects
    * More ways to upload images. Ex. User submits a link of an already uploaded image
    * upload .gif support
    * Edit images and gear 
* Index
    * Better Search Functionality
    * Table Styling that fits in with Semantic UI
    * Compare two mice
    * add Brand Logos to the Column
* Profile
    * add following/ Friend system to keep track of other users
    * notifications
    * link personal social media sites on profile page
* General
    * Rich Text Editor
    * Mousepad support
    * Keyboard Support

That is all I have planned for now. If you have read this far it means you have some interest in this project and I appreciate that. Thank you and stay tuned for further improvements to OnTheGears.
