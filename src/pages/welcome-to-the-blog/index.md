Welcome to the OnTheGears Development Blog! This dev blog will be used to communicate with users about updates and technical challenges. 


<!-- end -->

I have been building [OnTheGears](https://onthegears.com) for a couple months now and I am ready to put this proof of concept into action. The initial idea is a platform where mouse enthusiasts can share and collect (keep track of) their gear. However, that idea has expanded to mouse modifications and possibly other gear in the future. I will talk about the roadmap for this project in a bit, but first I want to talk about the current features OnTheGears has to offer.

# Features

### The Dashboard

Upon visiting the frontpage you are probably thinking that this is just a simple message board. While simple in its current state, it has been tailored to display information about mice and help users understand the ecosystem around the hardware. You can inspect the projects to see what specific model of mice are in the image and any type of modifications made.

### Posting

A user can post a project containing multiple images of mice and then find said mice in our catalogue. From there you can add predefined tags that describe mods applicable to your mice. These tags are meant to be more general and extra details about the change will be in the description.

### Mice Index

The gear page contains a table of all mice in the catalogue. You can search the table for your mouse and use the button in the model column to be directed a page containing a more nicely formatted spec sheet. Along with the better format is the ability to add the mouse to your collection. This will save the mouse to your profile and to display it for all users.

### Profile

The profile page is where you can find a record of all your collected gear and projects. This is the simplest page at the moment, but I have many improvements I want to make including a teased follow functionality.
 
And that is basically the gist of OnTheGears. As I hope you can see all these features are interconnected in some way. Now to discuss the future plans of OnTheGears!

# Roadmap

 These are my planned improvements for OnTheGears in no particular order:

* Rich Text Editor
* compare two mice
* add following and follower
* notifications for users
* link social media sites on profile page
* add icons to mouse list Brands
* add recent activity panel like when someone adds piece of gears to collection
* Search Functionality
* add higher comment depth
* Mousepad support
* Keyboard Support

That is all I have to write for now. If you have read this far it means you have real interest in this project and I appreciate that. Thank you and stay tuned for further improvements to OnTheGears.
